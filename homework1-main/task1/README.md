# Task 1: Implementing Echo Client-Server

In our class, we have learned that a basic TCP client-server model can be easily implemented with Python. This is the good starting point for learning how to implement a socket program. 

## Requirement

The `task1` directory has `echo_server.py` and `echo_client.py` where some code snippets are already written. Fill the rest of the code where the `TODO:` is commented in order to make them work properly.

If you write code properly, the programs will be working as follows:

1. Run `python3 echo_server.py` in one terminal.
3. Run `python3 echo_client.py` in another terminal.
4. Type any string you want to send to server from the client.
5. Check that the string is printed out from the server correctly.

## Writing-up

When writing a report, make sure that it contains answers for the following questions:

1. Briefly describe how your program works.
2. What's the purpose of `line 8` code in the `echo_server.py`?
3. If you want to use UDP instead of TCP in this program, which code snippets should be modified?
